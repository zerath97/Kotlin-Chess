# Chess made in Kotlin
Learning to build Graddle projects with Kotlin. The goal is to create a system that is easily maintanable, readable and efficient.
It should not just get the game working, but apply other functionalities and features such as networking for online or LAN play, ranking system, authentication system and there under friend list.

- This is my first project made in Kotlin.
It is created to learn to the principles of progrmaming in Kotlin, using the Object Oritiented Programming approach.

## Features
1. TODO: Logic and structures is coded in classes that make it easy to understand without need of extra documentation.
2. TODO: It has a working GUI with inputs from computer mouse and keyboard.
3. It has support for multiple chess boards run at the same time.
4. TODO: Online chess is to be done when all has been completed (This would allow for login system as well and hosting service/LAN).
